# Glucometer

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a low-cost glucometer based on an enzymatic biosensor whose electrical response is detected thanks to an analog to digital interface and later processed in LabVIEW.
This biomedical device will combine both hardware and software to acquire the glucometerâ€™s desired behavior.
